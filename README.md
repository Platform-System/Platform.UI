# Platform.MerchantUI

Merchant storefront UI built with Next.js. This app currently uses `@platform/api-client` to call the gateway at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

## Environment

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: gateway base URL for public and authenticated API calls
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_URL`: Keycloak server URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_REALM`: Keycloak realm name
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`: Keycloak client id for Merchant UI

See `.env.example` for the default local setup.

## Notes

- Seller storefront now uses live store and product endpoints for listing and detail data.
- Review detail, follower count, and member-since data are not currently backed by a storefront API, so the UI avoids showing fabricated sample data for those fields.
